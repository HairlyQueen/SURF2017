# SURF2017
-----------------
This is a project of XJTLU 2017 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship, it aims at designing a generative adversarial network to implement style transfer from a style image to content image. Related literature could be viewed from [Wiki](https://github.com/LinkWoong/SURF2017/wiki)  
## 1. Overview  
-----------------
**Neural Style Transfer** is one of the cutting-edge in deep learning field. Given an colored image, like [this](https://github.com/titu1994)proposed, and another image that contains the style desired, they could be combined by using **Neural Style Transfer** and it looks like this.
